			<h1 class="heading">Welcome</h1>
			<p id="p1">I am Taylorboi. This is my website. Your reasons for being here may vary but my purpose is one thing: to shitpost as much as possible while I teach myself HTML and CSS. While learning these skills, shouldn't I be devoting my time to doing something more productive with them? Well, I disagree. Anyway, now that you're here, make yourself comfortable. Feel free to click around. More than likely, every single page will be a continuous work in progress which I feel will give it some of it's charm.</p> 
			<p id="p2">I apologize in advance- if you are not one of the Lads then many of the references here will not make much sense. Actually, they may be equally as nonsensical to the Lads as well. This is just filler text. No one is actually reading this far. Barnacles have the biggest penis-to-body size ratio.</p>

			<p>Pictured below is the founder of this website: Dr. Taylorboi, the gentleman and scholar. His philanthropic works include making large contribution into the research to find a cure for Ligma. A colleague of Dr. Boi suffers from this grave illness and has thus inspired him to start the Limga for Medical Advancement foundation (or LMA for short). Other philanthropic works include: providing education for the people of Capra Aegagrus Hircus tribe. They are well known for their production of specialty diary products. Dr. Boi strongly opposes the use of chemical weapons in the war in Verdansk and will be starting a fund to provide medical care for those who have been injured in these chemical attacks. Dr. Boi also is the owner of both the Taylorboi Jazz Lounge in Chicago, Illinois and the Taylorboi Bonobo Wildlife Preserve in Boston, Massachusetts, which currently only houses one bonobo in it's collection.</p>
